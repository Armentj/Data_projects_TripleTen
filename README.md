# Data_projects_TripleTen

Projects I worked on while attending the TripleTen Data Science program and beyond. This portfolio focuses on reproducible analytics, clear business value, and high‑quality code.

## Table of contents

| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ------ | ----------- |
| 1 | [Instacart customer shopping habits](./instacart/README.md) | Analyzed Instacart customer behavior to uncover trends and insights using data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. Cleaned and merged large datasets with Pandas and SQL for accuracy and consistency; created visualizations and pivot tables (Excel/Sheets) to answer key business questions; performed statistical analysis (NumPy/Excel) to identify popular categories and peak shopping times. |
| 2 | [Video game sales forecasting](./video-game-forecast/README.md) | Built a data‑driven forecasting model to identify global sales trends and predict top platforms/genres for 2017. Developed a full analytical pipeline across 16 years of data (Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly; SQL); identified market and genre preferences across NA/EU/JP; analyzed correlations between reviews and sales; validated hypotheses via statistical testing; produced visual dashboards and narratives for campaign planning. |
| 3 | [Customer churn predictions for Beta Bank](./beta-bank-churn/README.md) | Predicted customer churn with **F1 > 0.59** using feature engineering and model optimization (Pandas, NumPy, scikit‑learn). Improved minority‑class reliability via SMOTE and class weights; engineered demographic/financial/behavioral features; evaluated with F1 and AUC‑ROC; selected algorithms via grid search and cross‑validation; delivered insights to inform targeted retention strategies.
